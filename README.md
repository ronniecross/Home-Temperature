# Home Temperature
This was a mini project to utilize the philips hue API to get the room temparature on my smart watch.

Note: There are things I would do differently if I was doing this today, and one thing is to store the API key as a value which the URLs would then be created from. As it stands, the URLs were hard coded. I do not intend to revisit this in the immediate future, however I've replaced the hard coded API key with a note to add the API key to the source code. The app will not work without doing this first.
